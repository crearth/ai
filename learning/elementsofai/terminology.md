# Key terminology

## 1: What is AI?
- Adaptivity

- Autonomy

### Extra
- The Turing Test (Alan Turing)
- Chinese Room test

## 2: AI problem solving
- The state space
⋅⋅⋅The set of possible situations.

- Transitions
⋅⋅⋅Possible moves between one state and another.

- Costs
⋅⋅⋅Transitions can differ in ways that make some transitions more preferable or cheaper and others more costly.

### Extra
- The Minimax algorithm
⋅⋅⋅It guarantees optimal game play in, theoretically speaking, any deterministic, two-person, perfect-information zero-sum game.

## 3: Real World AI
- The Bayes rule (or the Bayes formula)
⋅⋅⋅posterior odds = liklihood ratio x prior odds

- Prior and posterior odds
⋅⋅⋅The idea is to take the odds for something happening (against it not happening), which we´ll call prior odds. The word prior refers to our assessment of the odds before obtaining some new information that may be relevant. The purpose of the formula is to update the prior odds when new information becomes available, to obtain the posterior odds, or the odds after obtaining the information (the dictionary meaning of posterior is “something that comes after, later.)”

- Likelihood ratio (aannemelijkheidsquotiënt)
⋅⋅⋅The probability of the observation in case the event of interest, divided by the probability of the observation in case of no event.

### Extra
- Naive Bayes classifier

- "All models are wrong, but some are useful"

## 4: Machine learning
- MNIST dataset
⋅⋅⋅Modified National Institute of Standars and Technology

- Types of ML
⋅⋅* Supervised learning
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅We are given an input, and the task is to predict the correct output or label.

⋅⋅* Unsupervised learning
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅The task is to discover the structure of the data.

⋅⋅* Reinvorcement learning
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ Commonly used in situations where an AI agent like a selfdriving car must operate in an environment and where feedback about good or bad choices is available with some delay.

⋅⋅* Semisupervised learning
⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅ Partly supervised and partly unsupervised.
