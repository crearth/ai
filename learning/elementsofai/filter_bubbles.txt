Yes, I do think that filter bubbles are harmful. Whenever a user gets into a filter bubble, they think that their point of view of something is the only correct one, as they only see that content on their screen. It becomes dificult for them to understand other viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. In our world, mixing ideas and points of view is important for the society. When someone is not exposed to other viewpoints, they can react more radically when they see an opposing viewpoint. They can let themselves believe in conspiracy theories for example. (source: Bill Gates and Wikipedia.)

Algorithms behind content recommendation should sometimes recommend things that are a little bit opposing to their viewpoint. Every time it should be another opposing element, so that in the end, the user isn't looping in their own filter bubble. The algorithm should change the recommendations a little bit, so that the user isn't noticing the subtile changes. Also, limiting the use of such algorithms could help a lot against filter bubbles, because the algorithm would know less about the person and so the recommendations should be more diverse.
